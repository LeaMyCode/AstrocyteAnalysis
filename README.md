# AstrocyteAnalysis
Automatized pipeline to analyze astroyctic expression via intensity stainings and the area covered by astrocytes. 
Please see the code and an manual above.

_Example image of primary hippocampal culture stained for GFAP (green) and GLT-1 (red) is shown in the upper panel. Scale bar: 20 Âµm. Middle panel shows thresholded astrocyte using auto thresholding
with huang dark in FIJI. Lower panels show an selection overlay of the thresholded GFAP channel on the GFAP and GLT-1 channel._
